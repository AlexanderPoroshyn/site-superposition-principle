        <p><strong>Last updated: 23.02.2025</strong></p>
        
        <p>Superposition Principle ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our mobile game Strike Sortie (the "Game"). By using the Game, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect only in-game data necessary for gameplay, analytics, and service improvement. This may include:</p>
        <p><strong>Gameplay Data:</strong> Progress, achievements, in-game purchases, settings, and other data related to your experience within the Game.</p>
        <p><strong>Device Information:</strong> Non-personal device identifiers, operating system, and other technical data necessary for performance optimization.</p>
        <p><strong>Advertising Data:</strong> We use third-party advertising services that may collect anonymous data to provide relevant ads.</p>
        <p><strong>In-Game Purchases:</strong> If you make in-game purchases, we collect transaction-related data (but do not store payment details) through third-party billing services.</p>
        <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information such as names, emails, or phone numbers.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use collected data to improve and optimize the Game’s performance, track progress, manage features, provide a personalized experience, display relevant ads, and process in-game purchases.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>Your gameplay data is stored securely on our servers. We take reasonable measures to protect it from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We integrate third-party services for ads, analytics, and payments. These providers may collect and process information under their respective privacy policies.</p>

        <p><strong>Billing Providers:</strong> To process in-game purchases securely.</p>
        <p>We do not control how third parties use your data and recommend reviewing their privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Game is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided us with information, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>You have the right to request deletion of your gameplay data, opt out of personalized advertising (via your device settings), or disable in-game purchases through platform settings.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy as needed. Any changes will be posted within the Game and on our website. Continued use of the Game after updates signifies your acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
